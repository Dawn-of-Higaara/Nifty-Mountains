# Nifty-Mountains
This program reads a set of topographic data and uses several methods (Greedy Walks, Floyd Warshall's Algorithm, and Dijkstra's Algorithm) to compute several paths through the mountains that minimize change in elevation. The program then uses Allegro to illustrate the topographic data and paths for the user to visualize.
